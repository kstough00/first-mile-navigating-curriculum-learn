# Navigating the Curriculum in Learn

# Overview
The Online Software Engineering Program and our Learn.co education platform were launched in 2015, built around three core ideas: 
* **Real tools** - to ensure you are prepared for software engineering roles by using the tools and workflows that developers use on the job; 
* **Open curriculum** – to ensure what we’re teaching you is always relevant by integrating real-time feedback from instructors and our community; and
* **Community** – to make sure that while you are learning online, you’re not alone. 

Learn is designed for people who are passionate, curious, self-driven, and absolutely serious about learning to code. 

Most people on Learn have already been exploring code by using the amazing and plentiful resources all around the Internet. However, in developing the content on Learn, we designed it for beginners. If for any reason you find it overwhelming at first, ask for help.  (Asking for help is a skill of any good programmer, so don’t be shy to practice this now!)

Learn will demand that you be patient, resilient, resourceful, and gritty. Isn't that the kind of person you want to be? We think that's the kind of person you already are. The curriculum you'll encounter is rigorous. We don't dumb anything down because we believe in your infinite capacity to learn.

# Tracks
A curriculum **"track"** is a collection of many lessons, organized into topics. Clicking on the name of the track will open Track Navigation, which allows you to view topics and move between lessons.  As a student in the Online Software Engineering Program, you’ll be starting with the Online Software Engineering - First Mile track and then finishing the program on the Online Software Engineering - Structured track.

# Lessons
The individual pieces of curriculum on Learn are called **"lessons."** Before we go any further, let's get a little more familiar with how lessons work.

Later lessons build off the earlier ones, so it is strongly advised that you complete each lesson before you advance to the next one. Use this navigation to go back and review earlier content if needed.

Lessons you've completed will be filled in with a green circle, and your current lesson will be orange. You can always view your total lessons completed on your Learn.co profile page.

There are two types of lessons on Learn: **READMEs** and **Labs.**

<div align="center">The derogatory term “scrub” means several different things. One definition is someone (especially a game player) who is not good at something (especially a game). By this definition, we all start out as scrubs, and there is certainly no shame in that. I mean the term differently, though. A scrub is a player who is handicapped by self-imposed rules that the game knows nothing about. A scrub does not play to win.</div>
